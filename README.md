**Medical Term Extraction using Artificial Intelligence.**
This project focuses on developing and fine-tuning models for medical term extraction.

The project currently supports GLiNER, LLMs (using Unsloth) and Ollama models. It includes scripts for fine-tuning using LoRA, and provides examples for fine-tuning the models both locally and on [SLURM].

## ☑️ Requirements

Before starting the project make sure these requirements are available:

- [uv] or [python] (version 3.10 or higher). For setting up the environment and Python dependencies.
- [git]. For versioning your code.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

## 🛠️ Setup

### Python version

The Python version for this project is specified in the `.python-version` file. This file should contain only the major and minor version number (e.g., `3.12`).

If the `.python-version` file is not present or contains an invalid format, the setup script will default to Python 3.12.

To change the Python version:

1. Create and/or edit the `.python-version` file in project root
2. Specify the desired version in `X.Y` format (e.g., `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`)
3. Re-run the setup process (see below)

### Setup the environment

To set up the development environment, run the following command:

```bash
make setup
```

This will:

- Create a virtual environment at `.venv`
- Install all project dependencies (using `uv` if available, otherwise `pip`)
- Create necessary data directories (`data/raw`, `data/interim`, `data/final`, `data/external`)

> [!NOTE]
> The Python version is specified in `.python-version`. The setup script will use this version automatically.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Some components may require environment variables to be set. To set the environment variables, copy the `.env.example` file (if available) to `.env` and replace the values with the correct ones.

## 🚀 Running Scripts

Documentation of the different supporting models is available in [./docs/models](./docs/models).

Scripts and experiments in this project are run using:

- [uv] (default, if available): Fast Python script execution
- [python] (fallback): Regular Python interpreter

Both are supported. When [uv] is available, it will automatically be used for faster execution. You can explicitly use either:

```bash
# Using uv (faster)
uv run script_name.py

# Using python (always available)
python script_name.py
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

To clean up the project, run the following command:

```bash
make cleanup
```

This will remove generated files, caches, and compiled Python files.
